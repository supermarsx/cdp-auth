# cdp-auth

A CEF Client (Chrome/Chromium) CDP authentication automation tool for mRemoteNG. Allows you to auto fill forms and login to some types of login forms automagically and using Chrome inside in mRemoteNG.


## Changelog

0.0.2: 
- Added Field name typed automation option

## Known bugs/limitations
- Doesn't handle element ids or names with commas
- Doesn't handle iframe ids with commas
- Doesn't handle usernames or passwords with commas
- Sometimes startup is slow
- Sometimes `field_id` mode bugs out and can't login
- Passes clear password on a shell execute instruction to `cdp-auth`
- Can open a single instance of each login due to debug port
- Sometimes enter key on typed forms causes cdp error after login, workaround just by pressing the "back" button

## Possible bug fixes
- Handling commas, Wrap parameters in quotes or something maybe
- Passing clear passwords on shell execute, encrypt them with AES and store a key internally somewhere maybe or temp file?

## Known working logins

- Any basic auth interfaces, routers, switches, etc.
- pfSense (using field_id like `field_id,ADMINUSER,usernamefld,passwordfld`)
- HP Integrated Lights Out or ILO (using field_id+iframe like `field_id+iframe,ADMINUSER,usernameInput,passwordInput,appFrame`)
- Joomla (using field_id like `field_id,ADMINUSER,mod-login-username,mod-login-password`)
- Portainer (using field_id_typing like `field_id_typing,ADMINUSER,username,password`)
- Nginx Manager (using field_name like `field_name,ADMINUSER,identity,secret`)
- SQLPad (using field_name_typing like `field_name_typing,ADMINUSER,email,password`)

## Known not working logins

- ...

Note: Please report any working/non-working login with its full method to be integrated in the list. Do it by opening an issue or something.

## Quick start

### New `cefclient-embedded-passthrough`
1. Download the latest `cdp-auth` [release](https://github.com/supermarsx/cdp-auth/releases) (0.0.2)
2. Download cef client binary (if you don't have it yet) you can get this one from the [official source](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef), [spotifycdn mirror](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef) [my github mirror](https://github.com/supermarsx/mirror-cef_binary_155.3.13)
3. Extract `cdp-auth`to cef client folder
4. Configure `cefclient-embedded-passthrough` as an external tool 
    `cefclient-embedded-passthrough` should be passed the following arguments: 
    `%HOSTNAME% %USERFIELD% %PASSWORD%`
    pick "try to integrate" (Very important if you want it to be embedded on a tab inside mremoteng)    
5. Configure connections like
    - **Hostname/IP**: Full url with protocol and port like: https://examplemgmt.com:9000
    - **Password**: User password as normal   
    - **Protocol**: External Tool   
    - **External Tool**: (whatever you set as your cefclient-embedded-passthrough)  
    - **User field**: Depending on the type of authentication this field will look differently (refer to types of authentication below)   
6. Check if your cefclient folder contains `cefclient-embedded-passthrough`and `cdp-auth` beside `cefclient`.
7. Enjoy

### Old `cdp-auth-passthrough`

1. Download the latest `cdp-auth` [release](https://github.com/supermarsx/cdp-auth/releases) (0.0.1)
2. Download cef client binary (if you don't have it yet) you can get this one from the [official source](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef), [spotifycdn mirror](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef) [my github mirror](https://github.com/supermarsx/mirror-cef_binary_155.3.13)
3. Extract `cdp-auth`to a folder and cef client to another
4. Configure cef client as an external tool 
    cef client should be passed the following arguments: 
    `--remote-allow-origins=* --ignore-certificate-errors --remote-debugging-port=%PORT% --url=data:text/html;base64,PHA+PHNwYW4gc3R5bGU9J2ZvbnQtZmFtaWx5OiAiTHVjaWRhIENvbnNvbGUiLCBNb25hY28sIG1vbm9zcGFjZTsgZm9udC1zaXplOiAxOHB4Oyc+V2FpdGluZyBmb3IgQ0RQIGNvbm5lY3Rpb24uLi48L3NwYW4+PC9wPg==`
    pick "try to integrate" (Very important if you want it to be embedded on a tab inside mremoteng)
    the base64 message will show a nice "Waiting for CDP connection..." instead of going to google
    `ignore-certificate-errors` will allow to bypass the certificate errors automagically and open a remote debugging port on the specified port parameter on the connection.
5. Configure `cdp-auth` as an external tool and pass the following arguments: `%PORT% %HOSTNAME% %USERFIELD% %PASSWORD%`
6. Optionally configure `cdp-auth-passthrough` so console window stays hidden on execute (Recommended)
7. Configure connections like
    - **Hostname/IP**: Full url with protocol and port like: https://examplemgmt.com:9000
    - **Port**: Remote debug port (has to be unique to each connection)   
    - **Password**: User password as normal   
    - **Protocol**: External Tool   
    - **External Tool**: (whatever you set as your cef client)   
    - **External Tool Before**: (whatever you set as your cdp-auth)   
    - **User field**: Depending on the type of authentication this field will look differently (refer to types of authentication below)
8. Check if your cefclient folder contains `cdp-auth-passthrough`and `cdp-auth` beside `cefclient`.

### Types of authentication
Your "User Field" will look differently depending on the type of login form:

--

Basic Authentication: `basic_auth`: Basic authentication the uses a small box on top of the browser, common in some routers and switches
- format: `basic_auth,USERNAME`
- example: `basic_auth,admin`

--

Form Field ID: `field_id`: Form authentication using username and password input IDs
- format: `field_id,USERNAME,USERNAMEFIELDID,PASSWORDFIELDID`
- example: `field_id,administrator,usernameField,passwordField`

--

Form Field Name: `field_name`: Form authentication using username and password input names
- format: `field_name,USERNAME,USERNAMEFIELDNAME,PASSWORDFIELDNAME`
- example: `field_name,administrator,user,pass`

--

Form Field ID (typed): `field_id_typing`: Form authentication using username and password input IDs but values are "typed" in (Alternative when `field_id` doesn't work)
- format: `field_id_typing,USERNAME,USERNAMEFIELDID,PASSWORDFIELDID`
- example: `field_id_typing,administrator,usernameField,passwordField`

--

Form Field Name (typed): `field_name_typing`: Form authentication using username and password input names but values are "typed" in (Alternative when `field_name` doesn't work)
- format: `field_name_typing,USERNAME,USERNAMEFIELDNAME,PASSWORDFIELDNAME`
- example: `field_name_typing,administrator,usernameField,passwordField`

--

Form Field ID on Iframe: `field_id+iframe`: Form authentication using username and password input IDs when they're inside an iframe ID
- format: `field_id+iframe,USERNAME,USERNAMEFIELDID,PASSWORDFIELDID,IFRAMEID`
- example: `field_id+iframe,administrator,usernameField,passwordField,loginFrame`


You'll need to check the specific form you want to login using Inspect and see what type of form it is and whats the most adequate solution.

## Getting started with source
1. Clone the repository
2. Install modules using ` npm install `
3. .â€¦
4. Profit?

You can do npm start and pass arguments with it, you should because it doesn't really work otherwise.

Also you might need to recreate the `sea` folder and `dist` folder inside of it for the build to be successful.

`cdp-auth-passthrough.au3` is a small passthrough that hide the SEA console window on launch, very useful when not debugging to avoid pesky windows popping up.
`cefclient-embedded-passthrough.au3` is a bigger version of `cdp-auth-passthrough.au3` that generates a random debug port, embeds cefclient on a gui and serves as a passthrough for cdp-auth. (Current recommended way of automation)

### Auxiliary npm scripts
```
  "scriptsComments": {
    "start": "Run cdp-auth with arguments (recommended for debugging)",
    "tsbuild":  "Clean build typescript to javascript",
    "esbuild": "Create a commonjs version of the app to be built into a SEA",
    "sea-build": "Executes the builder script",
    "sea-build-full": "Run all necessary build steps"
  },
```
